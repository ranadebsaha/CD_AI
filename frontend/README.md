# AI-Based Road Debris and Garbage Detection System

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered deep learning solution to detect debris, garbage, and construction materials that are temporarily or permanently placed on roads in India. The system aims to improve road safety and assist local authorities in maintaining clean and safe roadways in rural and semi-urban areas.

## Problem Statement

In India, it's common for construction materials such as bricks, sand, soil, and stones to be temporarily stored on roadsides during building or wall construction projects. Additionally, bulk garbage is often disposed of or stored along roadways for extended periods. These obstructions:

- Create safety hazards and increase accident risks
- Make it difficult for pedestrians and vehicles to navigate roads
- Contribute to urban and rural cleanliness issues
- Require timely intervention from local authorities

## Solution

Our AI-based detection system uses computer vision and deep learning to:

1. **Automatically detect** debris, garbage, and construction materials on roads
2. **Classify** different types of obstructions (construction debris, garbage, etc.)
3. **Alert** local police and municipal authorities in rural/semi-urban areas
4. **Enable rapid response** for cleanup operations

## Technical Approach

### Dataset
- **Custom Dataset**: Self-collected images of road debris and garbage
- **Image Sources**: Real-world photographs taken across various Indian road conditions
- **Coverage**: Urban, semi-urban, and rural road scenarios
- **Diversity**: Different lighting conditions, weather, and debris types

### Annotation
- **Platform**: Roboflow for image annotation and dataset management
- **Annotation Type**: Bounding box detection for debris and garbage objects
- **Classes**: 
  - Construction debris (bricks, sand, stones)
  - Bulk garbage
  - Mixed waste materials

### Model Architecture
- **Framework**: Deep Learning-based object detection
- **Approach**: Computer vision for real-time detection
- **Output**: Bounding box coordinates and confidence scores

## Features

- ✅ Real-time debris and garbage detection
- ✅ Multi-class object detection (construction materials, garbage)
- ✅ Custom dataset trained on Indian road conditions
- ✅ Integration capability with alert systems
- ✅ Scalable for rural and semi-urban deployment

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debris-detection-system.git
cd debris-detection-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download trained model weights
python download_model.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Detection
```python
from debris_detector import DebrisDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = DebrisDetector('path/to/model/weights')

# Detect debris in image
results = detector.detect('path/to/image.jpg')

# Display results
detector.visualize_results(results)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple images
detector.process_directory('path/to/images/', output_dir='results/')
```

python app.py --model path/to/model --port 8000
```

### Cloud Deployment
- Docker containerization supported
- Compatible with AWS, GCP, Azure
- Scalable inference endpoints

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the system:

1. **Data Collection**: Submit more diverse images of road debris
2. **Model Improvement**: Enhance detection accuracy
3. **Feature Addition**: Add new functionalities
4. **Testing**: Test in different geographical locations

### How to Contribute
